This response provides instructions for replacing the favicon.ico file. Since the file is a binary file (an icon), it cannot be represented as text-based code. The update instructs to replace the existing favicon with a new one. Therefore, the action is to replace the existing file with the updated file. No code merging is possible in this scenario. The user should replace the existing `app/favicon.ico` file with the new logo icon file.
